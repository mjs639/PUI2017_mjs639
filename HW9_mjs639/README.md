HW 9

For HW 9, Assignment 2, I worked closely with Alex, Tarek, and Sarah. Tarek and I worked on the earlier elements of the assignment, and then Sarah and Alex joined forces with us to tackle the rest. Alex helped me figure out how to overlay the LinkNYC locations on top of the choropleth. Alex and I also worked closely on the final plot, which had some roadbumps due to merge issues.
