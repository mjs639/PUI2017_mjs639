The plot is very easy to read, and does a good job of representing the data. It looks as though the x-axis label may have been cut off, but the labeling of the parks by name makes it clear what I am looking at. The colors chosen for the issues are easily distinguished, are pleasant to look at, and should not lead to any confusion. The colors also work when viewed through lenses of deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia, making the plot accesible to persons with different sight abilities. Your plot does not appear to distort the data in any dishonest way, though it might be worth normalizing the amount of issues in each park against the size of the park to determine if size is a factor.  

In terms of changes, there are a few aesthetic ones that could make the plot more consumable to the everyday viewer. The colors could better correlate to the issues they represent (e.g. animal waste could be brown instead of graffiti, which is usually bright in color). Additionally, the listing of the issues in the legend could be updated to remove the underscores. It also might be useful to indicate the frequency of each issue per park, since the range between ticks on the y-axis is relatively large.  

# FBB ok
things you missed:
the resolution of the plot is terrible: the plot is blurry and there are haloes of color around the rigthing. 
the labels are far too small to be readable wheather the plot were tibe printed on a page or shown on a screen. The labels being chopped are unforgivable. 

9/10
