The plot is very easy to read, and does a good job of representing the data. It looks as though the x-axis label may have been cut off, but the labeling of the parks by name makes it clear what I am looking at. The colors chosen for the issues are easily distinguished, and should not lead to any confusion. I find the mix of colors to be aesthetically pleasing, Your plot does not appear to distort the data in any dishonest way, though it might be worth normalizing the amount of issues in each park against the size of the park to determine if size is a factor.  

In terms of changes, there are a few aesthetic ones that could make the plot more consumable to the everyday viewer. The colors could better correlate to the issues they represent (e.g. animal waste could be brown instead of graffiti, which is usually bright in color). Additionally, the listing of the issues in the legend could be updated to remove the underscores. It also might be useful to indicate the frequency of each issue per park, since the range between ticks on the y-axis is relatively large.
