The plot is very easy to read, and readily expresses the data being represented. The axes labels are specific, and the legend is placed appropriately. The colors chosen for the regression line and scatterplot work well together, and are easy on the eyes. The use of red and purple (where the prior subtracted from the latter yields blue) indirectly evokes a sense of water. The colors remain distinguishable when viewed through lenses of deuteranopia and tritanopia, though they become hard to distinguish when viewed through the lens of protanopia. However, as the colors are not mechanisms for conveying specific information in this plot, this does not impact the accessibility of the plot to viewers with different sight abilities.

Looking at your caption, I appreciate that you provided specific metrics to complement the visual. Though the plot speaks for itself, having the supplemental information made it easier to contextualize what the plot represents.

The one thing I would recommend changing would be to extend the y-axis to start a little closer to 0 so that we could more accurately visualize the rate of decline over the years. The shortened axis currently paints the decrease in a visually dramatic way, which could be interpreted as dishonest in certain contexts. Additionally, if this plot were being used to predict water consumption levels for the future, I would love to see the regression model extend beyond 2015, to showcase where our consumption levels will be in the near future. Lastly, though this is by no means a flaw in the plot, I as a viewer have a hard time conceptualizing billions of gallons. Perhaps it would be useful to provide a baseline for comparison!
